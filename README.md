## Analysis List

1.Country Anlysis.

Conduct analysis on the data to understand the different countries with the highest rate/lower rate of education completition and the countries that need to be improved.

2. Education analysis
   
 This analysis aims to answer the question of educations per country. The result of this can help to improve education in countries with worse education.

 ## Approach Used
Data Wrangling: This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace, missing or NULL values.

1. Build a database

2. Create table and insert the data.

3. Select columns with null values in them. There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set NOT NULL for each field, hence null values are filtered out.

##  Questions
1. How many unique countries does the data have?
2. Which country has the higher education enrollment rate?
3. Which country has the lowest education primary enrollment rate?
4. Which country has the higher rate of male people out of school in pre primary years?
5. Which country has the lowest rate of male people out of school in pre primary years?
6. Which country has the higher rate of female people out of school in pre primary years?
7. Which country has the lowest rate of female people out of school in pre primary years?
8. What is the the higher completion per male?
9. What is the the lowest completion per male?
10. What is the the higher completion per female?
11. What is the the lowest completion per male?
12. Which countries have the higher Unployment rate according to lower rate completion?
